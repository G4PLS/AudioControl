=== Standard Device Controls
Add a new Device called Standard that will automatically use the current standard device to modify/display values

=== Device Name System
Taking a look at the way I display device names in the dropdown. There is an improved version that is not in the store, so taking another look at it is a good idea to make sure its of good quality

=== Store Thumbnail
The current store thumbnail is very simple can be improved visually in a few ways

=== Update Actions
Because the UI improvements overall made it so that one Base Class got rewritten the actions need to get updated to the new class aswell
